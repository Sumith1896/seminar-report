% ABSTRACT GOES HERE
Something about space leaks
% Transformation-based query optimizers explore the search space exhaustively using transformation rules. This report looks at a specific problem of enumeration of all valid bushy join trees without cross products. We show that existing rule sets either fail to explore the complete space or explore the entire space but generate exponential number of duplicates. A literature survey of  techniques used for join enumeration in different settings is presented including DP-based and memoization-based algorithms for plan generation. We present two new methods for enumerating the search space which perform superior to existing methods.
